When changes have been committed to xmlGeoDbs

1. $XMLGEODBSROOT should point to HEAD version

2. define an environment variable for destination directory, e.g.
   setenv outDir /afs/slac/www/exp/glast/ground/software/geometry/data/HEAD

3. make sure that both constsDoc.exe and summary.exe exist in bin directory
   of detCheck.  Note regular build will not build summary.exe since it
   only compiles on Linux.  To build summary.exe, from cmt directory issue
          gmake Linux

4. cd detCheck/rh72_gcc2953
   (or whatever the binary directory is called)

   or (better option) use glastpack to invoke executables in steps
   5-7 below.

5. Run constsDoc for both "regular" and CAL-segmented geometries:

  ./constsDoc.exe $XMLGEODBSROOT/xml/flight/flight.xml $outDir/flight-doc.html

  ./constsDoc.exe $XMLGEODBSROOT/xml/flight/flightSegVols.xml     \
   $outDir/flightSegVols-doc.html

6. Run summary.exe for both geometries.  Also run for segmented with
   choice = "recon"

   ./summary.exe $XMLGEODBSROOT/xml/flight/flight.xml \
    $outDir/materialsSummary.html

   ./summary.exe $XMLGEODBSROOT/xml/flight/flightSegVols.xml \
    $outDir/materialsSummarySeg.html

   ./summary.exe $XMLGEODBSROOT/xml/flight/flightSegVols.xml \
    $outDir/materialsSummarySegRecon.html LAT recon

7. Run overlaps checker in dump mode, causing volume dimensions and
   relative positions to be output:

   ./test.exe $XMLGEODBSROOT/xml/flight/flightSegVols.xml \
   $outDir/flightOverlaps.txt verbose dump

               ---------------------------------------------

When a new rtag has been made for xmlGeoDbs,

1. $XMLGEODBSROOT should point to the new tagged version

2. Make a new output subdirectory for it.  E.g., if the tag is v3r7p1

   mkdir /afs/slac/www/exp/glast/ground/software/geometry/data/v3r7p1

   and define an environment variable, say outDir, to point to it 
   as above.

3-7. Execute steps 3-7 as above.


8. If output seems satisfactory, make a soft link to the new output directory

     ln -s $outDir $outDir/../RELEASED

   (if need be, get rid of old RELEASED link first)
